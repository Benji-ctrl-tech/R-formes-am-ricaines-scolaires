            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The following ideas are proposed to address the structural, academic, and human challenges of the current school system.</p>
            <p>They are not based on ideology, but on widely observed issues such as inequality, outdated teaching methods, over-reliance on standardized testing, and insufficient preparation for modern life.</p>
            <p>These proposals align with the general conclusions and recommendations of major educational institutions, including the U.S. Department of Education, the National Center for Education Statistics, the OECD, and UNESCO.</p>
            <p>Together, these organizations highlight the need for education systems that promote critical thinking, equity, student well-being, and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.</p>
            <p>The goal of these ideas is not to reject education as it exists, but to improve it — so that schools prepare students not only to work, but to think, adapt, and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

        <section id="Education Should Develop Thinkers, Not Just Workers" class="fade">
            <h2>1. Restore the Purpose of Education: Create Thinkers, Not Just Workers</h2>
            Quote: “I don’t want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers.” (Widely circulated, symbolic of an outdated mindset.)
            Development:
            <ul>This quote represents the very mentality that The School Uprising rejects — the idea that school should produce obedient workers rather than independent thinkers.</ul>
            Reform means:
            <ul>
                <li>encouraging curiosity instead of memorization</li>
                <li>teaching students how to analyze, challenge, and innovate</li>
                <li>valuing creativity as highly as efficiency</li>
                <li>Education should open minds, not narrow them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Shift From Memorization to Critical Thinking</h2>
            Quote: “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.” — Albert Einstein
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Too many classes focus on recalling facts for tests.</ul>
            <p>Reform should push the system toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>debates, discussions, and problem-solving</li>
                <li>real-world projects</li>
                <li>assignments where students create, not just repeat</li>
                <li>When students are trained to think, they become capable of leading future changes — not just following instructions.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Equality Into Education" class="fade">
            <h2>3. Bring Equality Into Education</h2>
            Quote: “Where you live should not determine whether you live.” — Barack Obama
            (Used here symbolically to address inequality.)
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Schools in wealthy areas have better equipment, more staff, and stronger programs than those in poorer communities.</ul>
            <p>Reform must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>equalize funding</li>
                <li>guarantee minimum resources for every school</li>
                <li>ensure each student has access to technology and safe buildings</li>
                <li>Education should not be a lottery based on ZIP code.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Support and Elevate Teachers" class="fade">
            <h2>4. Support and Elevate Teachers</h2>
            Quote: “A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.” — Henry Adams
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Teachers shape entire generations, yet many feel overwhelmed and underappreciated.</ul>
            <p>Reform includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>better pay</li>
                <li>reduced administrative overload</li>
                <li>ongoing training</li>
                <li>emotional and professional support</li>
                <li>When teachers thrive, students rise with them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Power of Standardized Testing" class="fade">
            <h2>5. Reduce the Power of Standardized Testing</h2>
            Quote: “Not everything that counts can be counted.” — Often attributed to Einstein
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Standardized tests measure memorization, not understanding. They create stress and limit how teachers teach.</ul>
            <p>Reform should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use portfolios of student work</li>
                <li>include creative problem-solving</li>
                <li>focus on long-term learning rather than test-week cramming</li>
                <li>Students are more than their scores.</li>

            <h2>6. Prepare Students for the Modern World</h2>
            Quote: “The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.” — Malcolm X
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Schools rarely teach financial skills, digital literacy, or modern communication.</ul>
            <p>Reform means adding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>financial literacy</li>
                <li>coding and technological skills</li>
                <li>media analysis and online safety</li>

            <h2>7. Put Students’ Well-Being at the Center</h2>
            Quote: “There is no health without mental health.” — World Health Organization
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Students face pressure, anxiety, and social struggles, often without proper support.</ul>
            <p>Reform should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>more counselors</li>
                <li>programs on stress management</li>
                <li>anti-bullying initiatives</li>

            <h2>8. Expand Career and Technical Pathways</h2>
            Quote: “Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree…” — Often attributed to Einstein
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Not every student wants — or needs — a university degree.</ul>
            <p>Reform must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create strong technical training programs</li>
                <li>provide apprenticeships and hands-on classes</li>
                <li>legitimize skilled trades as valuable careers</li>

            Quote: “Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.” — John Lennon (Used symbolically to highlight well-designed learning time.)
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Early start times and rigid schedules hurt learning.</ul>
            <p>Reform means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>later start times</li>
                <li>longer, more focused periods</li>
                <li>time for creativity, clubs, projects</li>
                <li>Students need room to breathe, think, and explore.</li>

            <h2>10. Give Students a Voice in Their Education</h2>
            Quote: “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.” — Margaret Mead
            <p>Development:</p>
            <ul>Reform requires student participation because students understand school better than anyone.</ul>
            <p>This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>student councils with real influence</li>
